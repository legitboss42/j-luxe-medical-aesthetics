Facial Consultation & Consent Form

Facial treatments at J Luxe are designed to cleanse, exfoliate, hydrate, and rejuvenate the skin
using clinically selected techniques and medical-grade products. Each treatment is tailored to
your skin type and concerns, and may include deep cleansing, extraction, exfoliation, advanced
serums, mild resurfacing, microneedling, or targeted rejuvenation methods.

A thorough consultation is required before any treatment to ensure safety, suitability, and optimal
results. Your medical history, skincare routine, and lifestyle factors help determine which
treatment is appropriate and which techniques or products should be avoided. Honest and
accurate information is essential to prevent complications and to create a safe, effective,
personalised treatment plan.
