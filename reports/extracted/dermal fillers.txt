Dermal Fillers Consultation & Consent Form

Dermal filler treatments are non-surgical aesthetic procedures designed to restore
volume, enhance facial contours, and soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles.
Using high-quality hyaluronic acid based fillers, these treatments help to support
facial structure, improve symmetry, and create natural-looking, balanced results
while maintaining individual facial harmony.Each dermal filler treatment is carefully
tailored to your unique facial anatomy, concerns, and aesthetic goals. Treatments
may be used to enhance areas such as the lips, cheeks, jawline, chin, nasolabial
folds, marionette lines, and under-eye region. Results are visible immediately but
not final, with continued improvement as swelling settles and the product
integrates into the surrounding tissue.A thorough consultation is required before
any dermal filler treatment to ensure safety, suitability, and optimal results. During
this consultation, your medical history, current medications, allergies, previous
aesthetic treatments, and lifestyle factors are carefully reviewed. A detailed facial
assessment is performed to determine the appropriate product selection,
placement technique, dosage, and treatment plan, as well as to identify any
contraindications. Honest and accurate disclosure is essential to minimise risks,
prevent complications, and create a safe, effective, personalised treatment plan
aligned with your aesthetic goals.
