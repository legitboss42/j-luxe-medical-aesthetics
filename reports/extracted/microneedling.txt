Microneedling Consultation & Consent Form

Microneedling creates controlled micro-channels in the skin using sterile needles
to stimulate collagen, improve texture, reduce scarring, enhance product
absorption, and support overall skin rejuvenation. It works by triggering the skins
natural wound-healing processes (inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling).
Results develop gradually over several weeks and may require 3-6 sessions
depending on skin concerns. Temporary redness, sensitivity, and mild swelling are
expected.
