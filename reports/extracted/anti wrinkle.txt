Anti-Wrinkle Consultation & Consent Form

Anti-wrinkle injections use carefully measured doses of a prescription-only
medication (Botulinum Toxin) to temporarily relax specific facial muscles
responsible for expression lines. By reducing repetitive muscle movement, the
appearance of wrinkles softens and the skin looks smoother and more refreshed.
Results usually begin to appear within 3-7 days, reach their full effect at around 2
weeks, and typically last 4-6 months depending on the individual. Ongoing
treatments are required to maintain results.
 
A thorough consultation is required
before any anti-wrinkle treatment to ensure medical safety, suitability, and the best
possible results. Your medical history, previous treatments, muscle activity, and
lifestyle factors help determine whether this prescription-only treatment is
appropriate and which injection techniques should be used. Providing honest and
accurate information is essential to avoid complications and to allow your
practitioner to create a safe, effective, and personalised treatment plan.
