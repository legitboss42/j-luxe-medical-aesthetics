Body Sculpting Consultation & Consent Form

Body sculpting treatments are designed to contour, firm, and refine the body by
targeting stubborn fat deposits, improving skin tone, and enhancing natural body
shape using clinically selected techniques and medical-grade technology. Each
treatment is tailored to individual body goals and specific concern areas, and may
include non-invasive fat reduction, lymphatic drainage, skin-tightening procedures,
electrical muscle stimulation, or combination therapies for optimal contouring and
smoothing.A comprehensive consultation is required before any body sculpting
treatment to ensure safety, suitability, and effective results. During this
assessment, your medical history, body composition, lifestyle habits, and treatment
expectations are carefully reviewed to determine the most appropriate approach
and to identify any contraindications. Providing accurate and honest information is
essential to minimise risks, prevent complications, and develop a safe,
personalised body sculpting plan that delivers realistic and sustainable results.
